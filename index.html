    <h1>M07 Tutorial (Part Two) - John Spangle</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>Since M07's tutorial did not make use of a 'real' web page at all, I went ahead and made one (this) for the sake of Replit. Below is a link to the GitHub page that has my work.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/JohnSpangleIVY/M07TutorialSpanglePt2">https://github.com/JohnSpangleIVY/M07TutorialSpanglePt2</a></p>
  <br>
  <p>Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Thanks!</p>
